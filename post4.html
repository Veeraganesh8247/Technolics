<h5>Mobile phone generations</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the early 1980s,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1G">1G</a>&nbsp;was introduced as voice-only communication via "brick phones".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-lifewire_phone_gens-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;Later in 1991, the development of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G">2G</a>&nbsp;introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service">Short Message Service</a>&nbsp;(SMS) and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service">Multimedia Messaging Service</a>&nbsp;(MMS) capabilities, allowing picture messages to be sent and received between phones.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-lifewire_phone_gens-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;In 1998, 3G was introduced to provide faster data-transmission speeds to support&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_calling">video calling</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">internet</a>&nbsp;access.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G">4G</a>&nbsp;was released in 2008 to support more demanding services such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_gaming">gaming services</a>, HD&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_TV">mobile TV</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_conference">video conferencing</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_TV">3D TV</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-lifewire_phone_gens-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G">5G</a>&nbsp;technology was initially released in 2019, but is still only available in certain areas.</p>

<h3>4G networking</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G">4G</a>&nbsp;is the current mainstream cellular service offered to cell phone users, performance roughly 10 times faster than&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G">3G</a>&nbsp;service.&nbsp;<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-lifewire_4g-4">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;One of the most important features in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G">4G</a>&nbsp;mobile networks is the domination of high-speed&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_(information_technology)">packet</a>&nbsp;transmissions or burst&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic">traffic</a>&nbsp;in the channels. The same codes used in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G">2G</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G">3G</a>&nbsp;networks are applied to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G">4G</a>&nbsp;mobile or wireless networks, the detection of very short bursts will be a serious problem due to their very poor partial correlation properties. A recent study has indicated that traditional multilayer network architecture based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Systems_Interconnection">Open Systems Interconnection</a>&nbsp;(OSI) model may not be well suited for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G">4G</a>&nbsp;mobile network, where transactions of short packets will be the major part of the traffic in the channels. As the packets from different mobiles carry completely different channel characteristics, the receiver should execute all necessary&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms">algorithms</a>, such as channel estimation, interactions with all upper layers and so on, within a very 'short' period of time.</p>

<h3>5G networking</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5G's performance goals are high data rates, reduced latency, energy savings, reduced costs, increased system capacity and large-scale device connectivity. 5G is still a fairly new type of networking and is still being spread across the nation. Moving forward, 5G is going to set the standard of cellular service around the whole globe. Corporations such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile are some of the notorious cellular companies that are rolling out 5G services across the US. 5G started being deployed at the beginning of 2020 and has been growing ever since. According to the GSM association, by 2025, approximately 1.7 billion subscribers will have a subscription with 5G service.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5G wireless signals are transmitted through large numbers of small cell stations located in places like light poles or building roofs.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;In the past, 4G networking had to rely on large cell towers in order to transmit signals over large distances. With the introduction of 5G networking, it is imperative that small cell stations are used because the MM wave spectrum, which is the specific type of band used in 5G services, strictly travels over short distances. If the distances between cell stations were longer, signals may suffer from interference from inclimate weather, or other objects such as houses, buildings, trees, and much more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 5G networking, there are 3 main kinds of 5G: low-band, mid-band, and high-band.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;Low-band frequencies operate below 2&nbsp;GHz, mid-band frequencies operate between 2–10&nbsp;GHz, and high-band frequencies operate between 20–100&nbsp;GHz. Verizon have seen outrageous numbers on their high-band 5g service, which they deem “ultraband”, which hit speeds of over 3 Gbps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main advantage of 5G networks is that the data transmission rate is much higher than the previous cellular network, up to 10Gbit/s, which is faster than the current wired Internet and 100 times faster than the previous 4G LTE cellular network. Another advantage is lower network latency (faster response time), less than 1 millisecond, and 4G is 30-70 milliseconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The peak rate needs to reach the Gbit/s standard to meet the high data volume of high-definition video, virtual reality and so on.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The air interface delay level needs to be around 1ms, which meets real-time applications such as autonomous driving and telemedicine.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Large network capacity, providing the connection capacity of 100 billion devices to meet IoT communication.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The spectrum efficiency is 10 times higher than LTE.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>With continuous wide area coverage and high mobility, the user experience rate reaches 100 Mbit/s.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The flow density and the number of connections are greatly increased.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>

<p>Since 5G is a relatively new type of service, only phones which are newly released or are upcoming can support 5G service. Some of these phones include the iPhone 12/13; select Samsung devices such as the S21 series, Note series, Flip/Fold series, A series; Google Pixel 4a/5; and a few more devices from other manufacturers. The first ever 5G smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S20, was released by Samsung in March 2020. Following the release of Samsung’s S20 series, Apple was able to integrate 5G compatibility into their iPhone 12s, which was released in Fall 2020. These 5G phones were able to harness the power of 5G capability and gave consumers access to speeds that were rapid enough for high demand streaming and gaming.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;Another type of cellular device that is being utilized is the 5G hotspot. For people who have a device that is only WiFi-capable, these 5G hotspots would provide strong performance when they don't have access to home Wi-Fi.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Private 5G networks are also growing immensely among businesses. 5G can help businesses keep up with the growing networking demands of newer technologies such as AI, machine learning, AR, as well as just regular operations. As stated by Verizon, a private 5G network allows large enterprise and public sector customers to bring a custom-tailored 5G experience to indoor or outdoor facilities where high-speed, high-capacity, low-latency connectivity is crucial.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>&nbsp;Having the access to such high performing networks opens the door to many opportunities for different companies. Being able to connect vast amounts of devices to a reliable and powerful network will be crucial for companies and their technologies moving forward.</p>

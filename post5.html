<p>The next generation of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphones">smartphones</a>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_awareness">context-aware</a>, taking advantage of the growing availability of embedded physical sensors and data exchange abilities. One of the main features applying to this is that phones will start keeping track of users' personal data, and adapt to anticipate the information will need. All-new applications will come out with the new phones, one of which is an X-ray device that reveals information about any location at which the phone is pointed. Companies are developing software to take advantage of more accurate location-sensing data. This has been described as making the phone a virtual mouse able to click the real world.<sup>[<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a></em>]</sup>&nbsp;An example would be pointing the phone's camera at a building while having the live feed open, and the phone will show text with the image of the building, and save its location for use in the future. The future of smartphones is ever-growing as smartphone technology is fairly new, existing only for the last two decades with the first one released in the market in 1994 by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>&nbsp;Currently,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone">smartphones</a>&nbsp;are ubiquitous, that many rely on as a tool for leisure, business, entertainment, productivity, and much more. There are currently 237 brands of smartphones with thousands of models combined, and these numbers are growing.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>&nbsp;Companies release smartphones for each use case and for different price segments. Over the decade the prices of smartphones have been rising, giving a boom to a low end and medium price segment. We can expect to see price ceilings gradually increasing in the coming years. Smartphones are becoming powerful computational tools in the medical industry, being used in and outside of clinics.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnitouch">Omnitouch</a> is a device via which apps can be viewed and used on a hand, arm, wall, desk, or any other everyday surface. The device uses a sensor touch interface, which enables the user to access all the functions through the use of the touch of a finger. It was developed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. This device uses a projector and camera worn on the user's shoulder, with no controls other than the user's fingers.</p>

<p><strong>Supercomputing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout the last decade smartphone SOCs have rapidly gained speed to catch up to desktop-class CPUs and GPUs. Modern smartphones are capable of performing similar tasks compared to computers, with speed and efficiency. Efficiency is what drives the mobile-first society where smartphones are ubiquitous.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>&nbsp;Computational speed measured in FLOPS of smartphone chips has been measured to be as closely powerful as a rat’s neurological column. With the rapid development in the smartphone's SOCs will soon be powerful enough to replace computer chips for the most part in the consumer market as smartphone SOCs are cheaper and very efficient while being as powerful if not more.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>6G Connectivity</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the go, connectivity is more important than ever as smartphones are adapting to more and more tasks that one has to do sitting in front of a computer.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6G_(network)">6G</a>&nbsp;connectivity will bring a whole futuristic realm that is yet not possible. Such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography">holographic</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_driving">autonomous driving</a>, etc. With ten times the speed of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G">5G</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6G_(network)">6G</a>&nbsp;can prove to blend&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a>&nbsp;within the real world to give an immersive experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6G_(network)">6G</a>&nbsp;has many applications in almost every industry. Internet-connected devices are ubiquitous, and hyper-connectivity like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6G_(network)">6G</a>&nbsp;will provide latency-free communication for a robust automation server.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Smartphone Metamorphosis</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone">Smartphone</a>&nbsp;companies try to blend form and function for optimal value for customers. Where some companies have come out with radical designs that totally change the norm of a phone design. Like the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung">Samsung</a>&nbsp;Galaxy Fold for example, which was a foldable phone that had a bendable screen.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>&nbsp;This was a prototype when it debuted but with three iterations and other companies adopting the design. With the new design, the retail price experienced a hike but soon as there will be more competition, prices will follow the market. The flexible screen technology gives opportunities to new design opportunities. The screen size has also played a big role in the smartphone industry as it has allowed companies to pack more tech into the body as well cater towards the high demand for big-screen smartphones.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_technology#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>&nbsp;The first popular touchscreen smartphone which was the first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">iPhone</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.">Apple</a>&nbsp;introduced in 2007 had a screen size of approximately 3.5”. That has almost doubled to 6.7” for Apple’s lineup of smartphones, while other companies have even crossed the size of 7”.</p>

<p><strong>Borderless technology</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Borderless phones are free from the shackles of the bezels, allowing the screen to be more free. Loading a larger screen into a limited phone size can increase one-handed operability, aesthetics, and a sense of technology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the technical problems faced by borderless, light leakage on the screen, accidental touch on the edges, and more fragile bare screens have all been obstacles to the popularization of this technology.</p>

<p><strong>Transparent phone</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Transparent phone is a mobile phone that uses replaceable glass to achieve a visual penetration effect so that its appearance is transparent. Transparent mobile phones use special switchable glass technology. Once the electrically controlled glass is activated by a current through a transparent wire, these molecules will rearrange to form text, icons and other images.</p>

<p><strong>Chip phone</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The idea is that a cell phone can be made directly at the chip level and implanted in the body. Cell phones are used as brain-assisting tools to help improve work efficiency and sensory experience.</p>
